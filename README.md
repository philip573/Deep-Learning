PROJECT NAME: Deep Learning Image Classifier (Browser-based)
            This project demonstrates a real-time image classification system built using TensorFlow.js that runs entirely in the browser—no backend required. Users can upload any image, and the model instantly predicts the object category using a pre-trained deep learning model (MobileNet). The predictions are displayed with dynamic confidence bars, and successful classification is celebrated with a confetti animation for an engaging user experience.
Features: 
  *Top 3 Predictions using MobileNet
  *Confidence Bars for each prediction
  *Confetti Animation on successful prediction
  *Instant image preview
  *Fully client-side only, no backend
  *Runs smoothly in any modern browser
Technologies Used: 
   *Deep Learning	-TensorFlow.js
   *Pretrained Model - MobileNet
   *Frontend	- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   *Animation	- Canvas Confetti
How It Works:
  *User uploads an image (PNG/JPG).
  *TensorFlow.js loads a MobileNet model in the browser.
  *The image is classified in real-time, and predictions are generated.
  *Top 3 predictions are displayed with progress bars showing the confidence.
  *A confetti animation is triggered after prediction.
